# Valuation, Roadmap & How to reach $20M+

## Current realistic valuation (software-as-product, pre-revenue)
- Early-stage codebase + IP: $25k - $150k (depends on product completeness, traction, contracts)
- With enterprise customers / recurring revenue & traction: $1M - $10M
- To reach $20M+ valuation you need: revenue, scalable onboarding, defensible IP, strong growth metrics

## 5 major pillars to hit $20M valuation
1. Product-Market Fit & Monetization (SaaS fees, platform fees, licensing)
2. Scalable Acquisition (partnerships with large charities, integrations)
3. Regulatory & Security (PCI/DSS, KYC optional for payouts, audits)
4. Growth Engine (native fundraising tools + crypto rails + autoposting)
5. Financials & Contracts (recurring revenue, enterprise deals, reseller agreements)

## 24-month roadmap (high level)
- 0–3 months: polish MVP, cloud CI/CD, invite beta testers, prepare sales materials
- 3–6 months: acquire first 10 paying customers, integrate PayPal + Coinbase, start revenue
- 6–12 months: enterprise integrations, white-label offering, refine ML donor models
- 12–24 months: scale user acquisition, close partnerships, focus on ARR and CAC:LTV optimization
- Exit goal: achieve predictable ARR, low churn, and healthy unit economics; target strategic acquirers (fundraising platforms, payment processors)

## KPIs to track
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)/ARR
- CAC, LTV, churn, conversion rate from visit→donation
- Average donation size & repeat-donor rate
- Gross platform fees collected monthly
- Number of enterprise / white-label deals
